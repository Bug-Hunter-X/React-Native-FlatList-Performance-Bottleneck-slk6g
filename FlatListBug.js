In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the `renderItem` function performs expensive operations or uses inefficient data structures, it can lead to dropped frames, stuttering, and poor performance. The issue might not manifest immediately with smaller datasets but becomes increasingly noticeable as the list grows.
